## Description

This Snake Game is a simple graphical game built using Python's Turtle module. It's a classic snake-eating-food game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.

## Features

- **Turtle Graphics:** The game utilizes Python's Turtle module for a graphical user interface.
- **Simple and Intuitive Controls:** Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's movement.
- **Scoring:** The player earns points for each food item consumed, and the score is displayed on the screen.

## Gameplay
